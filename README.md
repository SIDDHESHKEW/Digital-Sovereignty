Digital Sovereignty: How Blockchain Empowers Individual Data Ownership
Project Description
Digital Sovereignty is a blockchain-based platform that empowers individuals to take complete control over their personal data. Built on Ethereum, this project demonstrates how smart contracts can facilitate secure, transparent, and monetizable data ownership while ensuring privacy and user consent.

The platform allows users to register their data assets (stored as encrypted IPFS hashes), set access permissions and pricing, and manage data access requests from other parties. This creates a decentralized data marketplace where individuals maintain sovereignty over their information while potentially earning from its responsible use.

Project Vision
Our vision is to create a world where:

Individual Data Rights: Every person has complete control over their personal data
Transparent Data Economy: Data transactions are transparent, fair, and consensual
Privacy by Design: User privacy is protected through encryption and blockchain security
Monetized Personal Assets: Individuals can earn from their data while maintaining control
Decentralized Trust: No single entity controls the data ecosystem
